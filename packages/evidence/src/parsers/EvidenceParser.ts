/**
 * Owns bounded Tree-sitter parse sessions with lazy, verified grammar
 * acquisition.
 *
 * Create a parser for a group of source extractions, call `parse` for each
 * file, then await `close`. Grammar selection uses the configured artifact and
 * filename; acquisition starts only when that grammar is needed. Construction
 * and metadata inspection do not initialize a language or parse source.
 *
 * Each request owns a native parser and tree. Its callback receives a borrowed
 * session only after syntax completeness is established, and must return data
 * that no longer depends on native objects. The concurrency slot remains held
 * during asynchronous callback work, so a callback must not await another parse
 * or close on the same pool: that work can wait for the callback's own slot.
 *
 * Cleanup runs for successful extraction and every failure path. Closing
 * rejects new requests and waits for accepted callbacks; immutable process-wide
 * grammar data can remain cached for later runtimes.
 *
 * @example
 *   const parser: EvidenceParser = new EvidenceParser({ concurrency: 2 });
 *   try {
 *     const range: IEvidenceSourceRange = await parser.parse(
 *       {
 *         type: "typescript",
 *         file: "api.ts",
 *         content: "export const value = 1;",
 *       },
 *       (session: EvidenceParseSession): IEvidenceSourceRange =>
 *         session.range(session.root),
 *     );
 *   } finally {
 *     await parser.close();
 *   }
 *
 * @evidence contracts/common.md#principled-implementation A bounded pool runs each parse with its own native Parser and Tree, rejects ERROR and MISSING recovery anywhere in the tree, and lends a session to the callback.
 * @evidence contracts/common.md#clear-and-simple-design Grammar acquisition, admission and sessions are separate collaborators; the parser sequences them and owns cleanup.
 * @evidence contracts/common.md#prohibited-implementation-shortcuts Known grammar gaps are accepted only through EvidenceTypeScriptSyntax; every other recovery fails as parse-incomplete.
 * @evidence contracts/common.md#meaningful-documentation The class comment explains the lifecycle, the no-nested-parse rule and gives an example; every member is documented.
 * @evidence contracts/performance.md#efficient-algorithms Each parse is linear in source size; recovery inspection walks only error-bearing branches.
 * @evidence contracts/performance.md#reuse-equivalent-work Language loads are shared per grammar ID within the runtime, and verified bytes and loaded languages are shared process-wide.
 * @evidence contracts/performance.md#bound-retention-and-release-resources Parser, tree and session are released in finally for every request; close drains accepted work and drops runtime-local load promises.
